# Tag versioning

Every version is formatted as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and each part changes according to the following rules.

We increment:

* `MAJOR` when breaking backward compatibility,
* `MINOR` when adding a new feature which doesn’t break compatibility,
* `PATCH` when fixing a bug without breaking compatibility
